        <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Kelbe Schneider and I am a old soul in a young body. I am one quarter away from graduating with a BA from the Visual Communication Design program at Eastern Washington University. I will also graduate with a minor in Art. <a href="http://www.alrasub.com/humanity-is-my-religion-2/">Humanity is my religion</a> and I follow <a href="http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_lawofjungle.htm">The Law of the Jungle</a>.  I believe in equality. I have always had a love for animals and was raised as a vegetarian. I have a desire to learn about any topic I can get my hands on. I have the ability to adjust and feel at home most any place I enter or travel to, near or far. I am a lover of the outdoors and adventures. I am big on rock climbing. No adventure is too big or too small to take on in my eyes.
            </p>
            
        <h2>Professional Objectives</h2>
            <p>I want to pursue a job where I learn something new everyday. I am unsure of an actual title I would like to pursue. However, I would like to work and grow in my field or outside my field for a few years before going back to school to earn my Masters. Long term, I think I want to teach or move to another country to pursue design on a higher level. Potential companies I want to work for include, but are not limited to: <a href="http://www.armtheanimals.com/">Arm the Animals</a>, <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/">Nike</a>, <a href="http://www.prana.com/">Prana</a>, <a href="http://www.disney.com/">Disney</a>, <a href="http://www.vikingrivercruises.com/">Viking River Cruises</a>, and <a href="http://connectionsfromhallmark.com/">Connections from Hallmark</a>.</p>
